1. **But don't all web pages originate on the server, even pure HTML pages in .html files?**

  Yes. All of the files for a web site are stored on the server--.html, .css, .php, etc. But they aren't all processed by the server. HTML and CSS files, as well as image files, are sent directly to the client browser without worrying about what's actually inside them. PHP files are different because they contain code that's processed and run on the web server. It's not the PHP code that's sent to the browser, it's the results of running the PHP code that are sent, and these results are pure HTML and CSS.
